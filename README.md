The DIY MIDI Joystick project is a custom-built controller originaly designed for Elektron Monomachine (c).  
Joystick can be used for controlling other hardware and software music instruments, effects, and adding unique motion-based input to any MIDI-compatible setup.

Built around an Arduino microcontroller, the device supports multiple operational modes, channel selection, 
button inputs, and precise analog readings from X/Y joystick axes. 

It communicates through USB or classic 5-pin MIDI DIN input/output and supports MIDI IN → MIDI OUT (thru) forwarding.

Features:

Pitch Bend on X-axis
Split CC control (CC1 + CC2) on Y-axis
MIDI channel selection
Axis swapping (X ↔ Y)
Full calibration system
EEPROM storage settings
MIDI Thru
LED status indication
